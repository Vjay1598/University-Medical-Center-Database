# University-Medical-Center-Database

This database will also investigate further about the typical operations in a hospital setting and accordingly consider several base tables such as for medical staff as well as linking tables such as for patient appointments, physician schedules, nurse schedules, surgery room schedules, inpatient room schedules, and equipment reservations.
